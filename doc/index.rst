Batis
=====

Batis is a way to distribute and install desktop applications on Linux.
Users can get up to date software directly from the authors, whichever
Linux distribution they use.

Any user can install a Batis package, even if they don't have Batis installed.
Packages are regular tarballs, and include a standalone install script to run at
the command line. See :doc:`packaging` to distribute your program like this.
