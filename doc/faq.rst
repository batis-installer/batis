FAQs

No-one's actually asked them yet, but here the answers to some questions you
might have.

Can I distribute proprietary applications using Batis?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes. There are no restrictions on what type of application you can distribute.

Where do I upload packages?
---------------------------

Batis is not an app store - users will download the packages directly from your
website. For open source projects, code hosting services like Github, Bitbucket
and Sourceforge let you upload files and make them available.

In the future there might be a centralised index of Batis packages.
