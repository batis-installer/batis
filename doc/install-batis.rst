Installing Batis itself
=======================

Naturally, Batis is a Batis package itself. To install Batis the first time,
download it from (TODO LINK), unpack it and run ``install.sh``::

    tar xzf batis-0.1.app.tgz
    cd batis
    ./install.sh

When a new version of Batis is released, you'll be able to upgrade using the
version you already installed::

    batis install (TODO)
